# Circle Of life: An anonymous mental well-being community
An anonymous social networking platform that aims to solve adolescent mental health problems by eliminating the associated stigma. Polled 700+ people in a 4-phase online survey to raise awareness on mental-health, propagate the importance of emotional intelligence, especially during the pandemic, and to identify the issues faced by todayâ€™s youth. Analysis of the survey data clearly indicated the need for an emotional support system, while maintaining anonymity, to encourage honest reporting and to enable individuals to overcome the fear of judgement.
